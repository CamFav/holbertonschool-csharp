## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

**General**
- What are solutions in VSCode
- How are solutions different from projects in VSCode
- What is a class library
- What is a unit test
- What are the benefits of unit testing
- How to create and run tests using NUnit
- What is the Arrange, Act, Assert methodology
- How to effectively name your unit tests
- How to utilize the TDD approach
- How to consider edge cases

## Requirements
**C# Tasks**
- Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using dotnet
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All default C# files named Program.cs should be renamed to the name given in each task
- Each C# task requires its own folder and .sln file. Push all task folders to your GitHub and ensure the task names on the folders are correct
- You do not need to push your obj/ or bin/ folders
- All your public classes and their members should have XML documentation tags
- All your private classes and members should be documented but without XML documentation tags

**C# Tests**
- Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code
- All tests should be inside a separate folder and named as specified in each task
- All your test files will be executed using dotnet test
- We strongly encourage you to work together on tests so that you don’t miss any edge cases
