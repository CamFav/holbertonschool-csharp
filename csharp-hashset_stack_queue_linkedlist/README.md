## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

**General**
- How to create and use arrays
- What are Collections in C#?
- How to create and use hashsets
- How to create and use stacks
- How to create and use queues
- How to create and use linked lists
- How to use foreach

---

## Requirements
**General**
- Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using dotnet
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All default C# files named Program.cs should be renamed to the name given in each task
- Each C# task requires its own folder and .csproj file. Push all task folders to your GitHub and ensure the task names on the folders are correct
- You do not need to push your obj/ or bin/ folders
- In the following examples, the main.cs files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.cs files at compilation. Our main.cs files might be different from the one shown in the examples

## Task List

| Filename                         | Description                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0. Unique addition               | Write a method that adds all unique integers in a list to a HashSet and returns the sum of all values. |
| 1. Present in both               | Write a method that returns a sorted list of common elements in two lists.                             |
| 2. Only differents              | Write a method that returns a sorted list of all elements present in one or the other list, but not both.|
| 3. Full stack                      | Create and manipulate a Stack.                                                                        |
| 4. Queue it up                     | Create and manipulate a Queue.                                                                        |
| 5. Print a LinkedList               | Create and manipulate a LinkedList.                                                                   |
| 6. LinkedList length               | Write a method that returns the number of elements in a LinkedList.                                    |
| 7. Add node to the beginning      | Write a method that inserts a new node at the beginning of a LinkedList.                               |
| 8. Find value                      | Write a method that finds a value in a LinkedList and returns its index.                                |
| 9. Pop                           | Write a method that deletes the node at a given position in a LinkedList.                               |
| 10. Get node at index               | Write a method that returns the value of the nth node of a LinkedList.                                   |
