## Requirements
**Shell Scripts**
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
- All your files must be executable

**C# Tasks**
- Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using dotnet
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All default C# files named Program.cs should be renamed to the name given in each task
- You do not need to know about namespaces and classes yet. Namespaces should be omitted in this project. The default names generated in Program.cs for class are okay
- Each C# task requires its own folder and .csproj file. Push all task folders to your GitHub and ensure the task names on the folders are correct
- You do not need to push your obj/ or bin/ folders
